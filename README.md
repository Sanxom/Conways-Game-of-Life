# Conways Game of Life
 Conway's Game of Life recreated in Unity as a solo developer
- This is a zero-player game because its evolution is determined by its initial state
- To change patterns, update the Pentomino-R Scriptable Object in the "Patterns" folder and change the elements' X and Y values to your liking
